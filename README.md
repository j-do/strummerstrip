Strum: A simple modal scale reference for guitarists
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Useful FYI:
 - Ionian = Major scale
 - Aeolian = Natural minor scale
 - The sixth note of the Ionian mode is the root note of the Aeolian mode aka "relative minor"

To use the extension in chrome:
 - go to extensions 
 - make sure you check the Developer Mode box
 - then click on load unpacked extension
 - Do the file browser dance to where you downloaded it
 - click OK
 - Click on the launch link and
 - Boom...enjoy

Google wanted five dollars from me to upload this to the Chrome store, so I tweaked it and submitted it to Mozilla as a firefox extension...bamma.
